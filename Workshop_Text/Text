Disable HUD effects that might be annoying for some:

- Grain Spectator overlay
- Near Death overlay (Red Screen)
- Buring/On Fire overlay
- Sepia color overlay (Check Screenshots, it's a whole neeewwwww woooorld)
- Bloat Vomit overlay
- Siren/Stalker red scratch overlay

[h1][b][u]Important Notes[/u][/b][/h1]

- You will still see the film grain ONLY when you are in lobby, once you start the game it will be gone from spectator/death screen
- Clients log files will be polluted with 'No Material Found' logs. Server Logs won't have this issue because the mutator doesn't run on the servers at all
